# Reproducibility in Biomedical Science

This is the base version of the seminar "Reproducibility in Biomedical Science". The structure of the seminar is captured in the Obsidian vault that can be found in the `vault` directory. If you don't want to use Obsidian, the documentation can also be browsed directly on Github, [here](https://github.com/slobentanzer/reproduciblity/blob/build/vault/Reproducibility%20in%20Biomedical%20Science.md).
